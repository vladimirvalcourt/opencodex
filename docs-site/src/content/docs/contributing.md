description: Develop opencodex — setup, layout, conventions, and how to add a provider or adapter.
---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex.git
cd opencodex
bun install
bun run dev:proxy    # proxy API in dev mode
bun run dev:gui      # dashboard dev server (another terminal)
bun x tsc --noEmit   # typecheck (must be clean)
```

`bun run dev` remains an alias for `bun run dev:proxy`. The dashboard dev server is `bun run dev:gui`;
the packaged dashboard at `GET /` is produced by `bun run build:gui` (`gui/dist`).

The docs site you're reading lives in `docs-site/` (Astro + Starlight):

```bash
cd docs-site && bun install && bun dev
```

## Docs publishing

The public docs publish to GitHub Pages at <https://lidge-jun.github.io/opencodex/>. The
`.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` workflow runs on `main` pushes that touch `docs-site/**` or the
workflow itself, builds `docs-site`, and deploys the generated site. Before pushing docs changes,
run:

```bash
cd docs-site
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
```

## CI and releases

GitHub Actions intentionally stay small:

- **Cross-platform CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on pull requests and `main` pushes that
  touch runtime, tests, package, script, TypeScript, or workflow files. It verifies Linux and Windows
  with install, typecheck, tests, a release-helper build smoke, and `ocx help`.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is manual. It does not act as a second full CI
  pipeline; before dry-run or publish it requires the exact release commit (`GITHUB_SHA`) to already
  have a successful Cross-platform CI run.

Use the helper for releases:

```bash
bun run release <version>           # commits/pushes the bump; publish workflow is dry-run by default
bun run release <version> --publish # publish after the CI-gated dry run is understood
bun run release:watch               # watch the newest Release workflow run
```

## Conventions

- **ES Modules only** (`import`/`export`), TypeScript, `strict` mode. Keep `bun x tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **~500 lines per file max** — split by responsibility (the `web-search/` and `vision/` sidecars are
  good examples of small, focused modules behind a single `index.ts`).
- **Handle async errors at boundaries** — sidecars never throw into the request path; they degrade to
  a graceful marker.
- **Structure SOT** — current maintainer invariants live in `structure/`. Keep public user workflows
  in `docs-site/` and historical investigation notes in `docs/`.
- **Preserve exports** — other modules may depend on them.

## Adding a provider to the catalog

Most providers are just an entry in the API-key catalog (`src/oauth/key-providers.ts`):

```ts
"my-provider": {
  label: "My Provider",
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com/v1",
  adapter: "openai-chat",
  dashboardUrl: "https://example.com/keys",
  models: ["model-a", "model-b"],
  defaultModel: "model-a",
  noVisionModels: ["model-a"],   // text-only models → vision sidecar describes images
}
```

`enrichProviderFromCatalog()` copies `models` / `noVisionModels` / `noReasoningModels` onto the
created provider config, so classifications take effect automatically. For OAuth providers, add to
`OAUTH_PROVIDERS` in `src/oauth/index.ts` instead.

## Adding an adapter

Implement `ProviderAdapter` (see [Adapters](/opencodex/reference/adapters/)) in `src/adapters/`,
register it in the adapter resolver, and bridge its output to internal `AdapterEvent`s. Reuse
`image.ts` for image handling and follow `openai-chat.ts` as the reference for streaming + tool calls.

## Verify before you claim done

Run the narrowest command that proves your change — `bun x tsc --noEmit` for types, a focused runtime
probe for behavior. opencodex favors small, verifiable commits over large batches.
