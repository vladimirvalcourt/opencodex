# Gemini 3.6 Flash rollout plan

- Date: 2026-07-22
- Branch: `gemini-3.6`
- Work class: C3 — provider catalog, wire routing, persisted OAuth presets, usage pricing, and tests move together.
- Status: P reopened on user authorization for implementation, live tier verification, and local `dev` merge.

## Loop spec

- Archetype: satisfy-spec integration.
- Trigger: Google released `gemini-3.6-flash` as GA on 2026-07-21, while authenticated Antigravity discovery simultaneously began returning 3.6-specific wire IDs.
- Goal: make Gemini 3.6 selectable and correctly routed without erasing still-supported Gemini 3.5 outside Antigravity.
- Non-goals: Vertex AI promotion, Cursor/OrcaRouter/OpenRouter speculative seeding, a global Gemini sampling-parameter migration, manual edits to generated jawcode metadata, or changing the direct Google provider's default model.
- Verifier: focused provider/adapter/catalog/usage tests, `bun run typecheck`, authenticated Antigravity discovery, one minimal live request per newly exposed Antigravity tier before and after the implementation, and a post-merge smoke check in the local `dev` worktree.
- Stop condition: the static/runtime catalogs match the surface matrix below, old Antigravity selections migrate without remaining visible, all focused tests and typecheck pass, and each new Antigravity tier returns a valid response.
- Memory artifact: this unit folder. C/D evidence is appended here before moving the folder to `devlog/_fin/`.
- Expected terminal outcomes: `DONE`, `BLOCKED` when upstream removes or rejects a discovered ID, or `NEEDS_HUMAN` when live verification would require an unavailable Google API credential.
- Escalation: implementation remains in the main session. The mandatory A-gate uses one read-only independent reviewer; after two failed reviewer correction loops the main session stops and reports the unresolved contradiction.

## 2026-07-22 execution authorization and pre-build live proof

The user expanded the docs-only handoff into an implementation request: call every newly discovered Antigravity tier directly, finish the rollout, and merge the branch into the local `dev` worktree. No push or release was requested.

Sanitized direct CCA calls through the existing adapter and local OAuth credential returned:

| Wire model | HTTP | Output marker |
|---|---:|---|
| `gemini-3.6-flash-low` | 200 | `OK--LOW` |
| `gemini-3.6-flash-medium` | 200 | `OK-DIUM` |
| `gemini-3.6-flash-high` | 200 | `OK-HIGH` |

The probe emitted no token, project ID, authorization header, or raw upstream error body. This proves all three discovered wire IDs accept inference before catalog exposure changes.

## Security boundary for live verification

- Assets: the local Antigravity OAuth access/refresh tokens and discovered project ID.
- Entrypoint and trust boundary: a local read of the existing OAuth store followed by an HTTPS request to the fixed `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` base URL already owned by the provider registry.
- Attacker assumption: repository/model text is untrusted, but it cannot choose the destination URL, headers, or credential fields in this fixed probe.
- Controls: never print or persist credentials/project identifiers; use the existing adapter's redacted error formatter and retry path; record only model ID, HTTP status, and a short model output; run a secret scan on the resulting diff.
- Blast radius: three minimal quota-consuming inference calls per verification pass. No credential, account, or provider configuration mutation is needed for the probe.

## User direction translated into surface rules

| Surface | Current 3.5 state | Gemini 3.6 decision |
|---|---|---|
| `google-antigravity` OAuth | 3.5 Low/Medium/High are exposed through mixed wire IDs and aliases | Replace visible 3.5 rows with explicit 3.6 Low/Medium/High wire IDs. Keep old 3.5 IDs only as hidden inbound compatibility aliases. |
| `google` API key | `gemini-3.5-flash` is the default and `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` is also seeded | Add `gemini-3.6-flash`; retain 3.5 and keep 3.5 as default. |
| Cursor | Current authenticated catalog contains 3.5 but not 3.6 | No static addition until Cursor advertises 3.6. |
| OrcaRouter | Static seed contains `google/gemini-3.5-flash`; the 3.6 model page currently returns 404 | No addition until OrcaRouter advertises the exact ID. |
| Generated jawcode snapshot | Source and generated files contain 3.5 but not 3.6 | Do not hand-edit generated output. Use registry hints and a verified local price overlay until jawcode gains the row. |

## Fixed decisions

1. Antigravity exposes `gemini-3.6-flash-low`, `gemini-3.6-flash-medium`, and `gemini-3.6-flash-high`.
2. `gemini-3.6-flash-tiered` remains hidden because authenticated discovery returns no display name and the visible Antigravity choices already have explicit tier IDs.
3. The Antigravity default becomes `gemini-3.6-flash-medium`. This preserves the effective current default: the existing `gemini-3.5-flash-low` wire row is displayed upstream as “Gemini 3.5 Flash (Medium).”
4. Hidden compatibility mappings preserve old selections:
   - `gemini-3.5-flash-extra-low` -> `gemini-3.6-flash-low`
   - `gemini-3.5-flash-low` and `gemini-3.5-flash-mid` -> `gemini-3.6-flash-medium`
   - `gemini-3.5-flash-high` and `gemini-3-flash-agent` -> `gemini-3.6-flash-high`
5. Direct Google keeps `gemini-3.5-flash` as default. “Add elsewhere” does not silently change existing API-key users' default.
6. Direct Google 3.6 advertises the repository's Codex-facing `low`/`medium`/`high` ladder and sends the selected level as Gemini `generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel`. The existing 3.5 path receives the same missing wire fix so the new model does not copy a catalog-only effort control.
7. Deprecated `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` are not removed in this slice. Google marks them deprecated, not rejected; changing global request shaping needs separate compatibility evidence.

## Scope

### IN

- Antigravity visible model replacement plus hidden compatibility aliases.
- Direct Google 3.6 static model, context, image-input, and reasoning metadata.
- Direct Google 3.5/3.6 thinking-level request wiring.
- Gemini 3.6 public-list-price and Antigravity-derived usage overlays.
- Existing-config reconciliation and regression tests.
- Fresh runtime proof after implementation and daemon restart.

### OUT

- Vertex AI: Gemini Developer API evidence does not prove Vertex publisher availability.
- Cursor: authenticated current list has no 3.6 row.
- OrcaRouter: exact 3.6 model page is absent.
- OpenRouter: dynamic catalog owns exposure; no 3.5 static seed is being replaced here.
- `src/generated/jawcode-model-metadata.ts`: generated file, and its current source has no Gemini 3.6 row.
- Benchmark fixtures and docs-site benchmark data: historical measurements are not model availability declarations.

## Dependency-ordered work-phase map

| Phase | Document | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Research and contract lock | `001_research_contract.md` | Official API contract, authenticated Antigravity IDs, and exclusions are durable. |
| 1 — Catalog, wire, migration, and verification | `010_model_catalog_and_wire_plan.md` | One coherent implementation slice updates runtime owners, compatibility, prices, tests, and live proof. |

## Acceptance criteria

- `google-antigravity` lists only 3.6 Low/Medium/High for the Flash family; no 3.5 Flash row or `gemini-3-flash-agent` remains picker-visible.
- Routing an old 3.5 Antigravity ID emits the corresponding 3.6 wire ID, while fresh 3.6 IDs pass through unchanged.
- A persisted OAuth config whose default is `gemini-3.5-flash-low` reconciles to `gemini-3.6-flash-medium` on startup without touching credentials or unrelated provider settings.
- Direct `google` lists `gemini-3.6-flash`, `gemini-3.5-flash`, and `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`; the default remains `gemini-3.5-flash`.
- Direct 3.6 catalog metadata reports 1,048,576 context, image input, and low/medium/high reasoning choices.
- Activation scenario for effort wiring: a direct Google 3.6 request with `reasoning: "high"` contains `generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel = "high"`; an unset effort omits `thinkingConfig`.
- Usage resolution returns the verified 3.6 public price for direct Google and derived prices for all three visible Antigravity tiers. Hidden 3.5/legacy compatibility IDs retain exact-key overlays whose prices and evidence point to their mapped 3.6 tiers, because cost matching currently receives the requested ID rather than the resolved wire ID.
- Cursor and OrcaRouter remain unchanged.
- Focused tests and typecheck pass; after `ocx restart`, all three 3.6 Antigravity tiers complete a minimal live prompt.
- The completed Gemini branch is committed and merged with a normal merge into the local `dev` worktree without modifying or staging its unrelated `devlog/_plan/260722_issue_bug_sweep/000_plan.md` change. No remote push is performed.
- After merged-`dev` verification passes, the linked `/Users/jun/.codex/worktrees/2d67/opencodex` worktree is removed from the main repository. The merged `gemini-3.6` branch ref is retained unless separately requested.

## Risks and rollback

- Upstream Antigravity IDs may change without announcement. The authenticated `fetchAvailableModels` list is the verifier; a missing ID blocks live completion rather than triggering guessed aliases.
- Hiding old IDs without compatibility aliases would break saved combos or manually selected slugs. Compatibility aliases are therefore separated from picker exposure.
- A live request can consume account quota. Verification uses one minimal prompt per tier and records only status/model identity, never OAuth tokens or raw credential payloads.
- Rollback restores the old Antigravity visible list/default, removes the direct 3.6 seed and overlays, and reverts the focused tests. No persistent data migration is introduced.
- Local integration uses `git merge --no-ff gemini-3.6` as explicitly directed after confirming the branch histories and changed paths. Hash the unrelated dirty file before and after, and stop rather than stash or discard user work if the merge would touch it.
- Worktree cleanup runs only after the merge commit, post-merge tests, merged-SHA check, and dirty-file preservation check pass. Invoke `git worktree remove` from the main repository so cleanup does not operate from inside the directory being removed.
